<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Every day I get the chance to make someone feel beautiful, and confident while building meaningful relationships!</p>
<p>Specializing in color correcting, fantasy colors and blondes, I haven't stopped learning about my passion and building my career since I graduated from Hair Benders Beauty Academy in 2014. Growing up with my mom (a hairstylist) in the salon, I was practically destined to be behind the chair! For the past 8.5 years my main goal has been to create unique hairstyles that fit my clients needs, wants, lifestyle and aesthetic through customizing color and cut combinations!</p>
<p>On my off time, I love to practice self-care! Tanning by the pool; watching movies with m dog, Ginger; giving myself a mini spa day; or learning a new recipe. The little things in life truly make me happy.</p>
